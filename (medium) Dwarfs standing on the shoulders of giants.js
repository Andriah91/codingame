/**
 * Dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants (medium)
 * This puzzle uses the oriented graph data structure. You can solve it
 * using recursive function to go through nodes of a tree using a Depth
 * First Search Algorithm.
 * 
 * Statement:
 * The goal of the puzzle is to make you compute the height of a tree data
 * structure. It will make you discover how to build a tree and use
 * recursive algorithm to compute the longest chain of nodes. The graph
 * theory behind the algorithm of this puzzle is one of the most important
 * aspects of programming and is at the base for a lot of tools and
 * application today (like google, facebook, twitter, â€¦).
 * 
 * Story:
 * It is sometimes interesting to find what authors has influenced our
 * favorite writer. What if we tried to find out who herited from whom, with
 * the help of an influence graph?
