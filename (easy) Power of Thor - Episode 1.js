/** Power of Thor - Episode 1 (easy) https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/power-of-thor-episode-1
 * In this puzzle, you need to compare different values. You have to
 * correlate character variables and integer variables.
 * A straightforward solution uses 8 conditions. There is a way to
 * simplify it and use only 4 conditions.
 *
 * Statement:
 * A basic problem to go a little bit further with conditions and variables:
 * your program must allow Thor to reach the coordinates of the light of
 * power in a 2D field.
 *
 * Story:
 * Thor's hammer, MjÃ¶llnir, has lost all of its powers... Will you be able to
 * guide Thor towards the light of power to make the hammer whole again?
