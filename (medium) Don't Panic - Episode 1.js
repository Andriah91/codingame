/** Don't Panic - Ep. 1 (medium) https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/don't-panic-episode-1
 * In this puzzle, you learn to position an object on a one-dimensional grid.
 * 
 * Statement:
 * Guide the clones towards the exit of the maze, stop when youâ€™re going away
 * from the exit, continue if you are going the right way. You are given the
 * position and direction of your clones.
 * 
 * Story:
 * Marvin is stuck inside the core of the Infinite Improbability Drive! Grab
 * your towel and help him (or them) escape by blocking the right clones to
 * allow others to reach the exit by going through the right Happy Vertical
 * People Transporters.
